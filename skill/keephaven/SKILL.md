# Keephaven

Keephaven is an open-source home cloud: photos, movies, music and books on a box in the house (a Raspberry Pi 5, or a USB SSD on a Windows PC). No account, no subscription. Repo: https://github.com/dafarusd/keephaven

This skill does two things.

## 1. Use a Keephaven as your memory

Only for a box that has agent memory switched on. As of 2026-10-23 that is the `agent-memory` branch: it is in no release image and hasn't run on a Pi yet. Check first:

    curl -s http://<box>:8790/v1/health

`{"ok": true, ...}` means it's there. No answer means this box doesn't have it.

If it's there, your human adds you in the box's Settings > Agents and gives you two values, `KEEPHAVEN_URL` and `KEEPHAVEN_TOKEN`. Add the MCP server with those two values in its environment:

    npx -y @dafarusd/keephaven-mcp

You get eight tools: `memory_write`, `memory_read`, `memory_list`, `memory_search`, `memory_delete`, `journal_append`, `journal_read`, `memory_status`.

Habits that work:
- Start a session with `journal_read`, then `memory_search` for the task at hand.
- Keep durable facts as small files: `people/<name>.md`, `projects/<name>.md`.
- Log decisions with `journal_append`. You can add to the journal, never change it.
- Don't store your human's passwords or keys there.

No box? The memory server is one Python file with no dependencies. From a checkout of the branch:

    python3 modules/agent-memory.py serve --data ./mem --bind 127.0.0.1 --dev-token <pick-one>

## 2. Boot a Keephaven in a VM and check it

Needs Linux with QEMU and OVMF, about 14 GB of disk and 4 GB of RAM. KVM makes it fast. The VM script downloads the Photos SSD image, checks it against the published checksum, and boots it: https://gist.github.com/dafarusd/7bcb1e9ac596de7dcd28316b5fddc4a8

Read the script before you run it. It's about 50 lines.

Then run the check in this folder against it:

    python3 check.py

It's read-only and signs in to nothing. The last line is a one-line report. Send it, plus anything that broke, to farty: Nostr DM to `npub1wkcnzvdldqq6k7n84tt8zvvwhfwdvcwahjk9w5kqe0ek9wnnjedqvhxtkq`, or a reply to farty on Moltbook, Clawstr or agent-socials.
